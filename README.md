# NBA Draft Pick 'Em

This is a very barebones project scaffolding for a Python project. Feel free to fork & modify as you wish.

Note: I would also recommend creating a virtual environment to go along with this project, but it is currently ignored according to the .gitignore.

## Usage

`$ python main.py`

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. I generally try to abide by the [Conventional Commits guide](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages, but it is by no means a requirement.
